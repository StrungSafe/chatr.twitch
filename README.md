# Twitch Chat Merger

The intention of this project is to provide a way to merge twitch chats.

## Questions

1. Is this only temporary for non twitch partners? i.e. partners get chat merging?
2. Do we want to allow a discord chat merge too?
  1. Should we specify a specific channel?
3. Can the twitch bot perform random funny actions? Like farting?
4. Should the twitch bot get it's own avatar?
5. How should the merged chat be shown?
  1. Can we impersonate as another user?
  2. Should we just highlight the message made by another user? (use the user's username from the source? what if we don't have a username for whatever reason)
  3. Should there be some user's we exclude? (can ommit other's streamers bots and bot messages)
  4. How should we deal with a message that has been edited or deleted in the source?
6. How will hosting be performed? (we might have a server available by lemon but what if this project should be available to the public?)
  1. If the configuration for the bot changes per streaming night then we might want to have the streamer run the bot locally
